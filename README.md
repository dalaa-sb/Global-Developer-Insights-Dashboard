# Global-Developer-Insights-Dashboard-
A data-driven dashboard built from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey. After performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), the insights were visualized in IBM Cognos Analytics to highlight current technology usage, future trends, and developer demographics.
The dashboard is divided into three main sections:

1. Current Technology Usage
Shows the top technologies respondents have worked with, including:
Most used programming languages
Most used databases
Most used platforms
Most used web frameworks

2. Future Technology Trends
Highlights what developers plan to learn next year:
Most desired programming languages
Most desired databases
Platforms developers want to use
Web frameworks developers are interested in

3. Demographics
Provides context about the survey population:
Countries of respondents
Age groups
Education levels

This project demonstrates skills in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and dashboard design, while translating raw survey data into clear insights that reveal patterns in the software development ecosystem.
